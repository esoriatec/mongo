# Mongo

## Build a Mongo Virtual Machine
Use **Vagrant** to build a virtual machine with:
- centos 7.2
- mongo 3.2

To build the virtual machine, you must have Vagrant and Virtualbox installed.
Then:
- Clone the project
- Go to the directory where you have the vagrantfile
- And type `« vagrant up »` 
- You can connect with `« vagrant ssh »`
- You can launch the Mongo shell with `« mongo » `
